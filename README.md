Vision
----------------

* Provide an elegant, lightweight, and simple extensibility framework suitable for a broad range of applications.

Scope
----------------

* Clean and maintain current code base with the goal of moving towards a more cohesive and feature full state.

Why use pyTensible?
----------------

pyTensible has been designed to make it easier to build large maintainable code bases in Python.
By borrowing concepts from more structured languages, pyTensible makes it possible to organize your code
more effectively because you can focus on the details of what each component provides to the system 
rather than when and how it will load.
